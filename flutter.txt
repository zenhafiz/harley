Flutter

Heart viciously knocks on my frontal lobe
My sleep just got briefer
Unidentified impulse flows through my body
I am startled to consciousness

The random diction you spat 
and your parlance
Ruthlessly attack my rationality 
and crumbles the wall in my heart

I am in anguish
What can I do about the lavishing emotions and excitement
Right hand which checks the notifications every minute
and stupidly bumping heart seem to wait only your response

by Harley Quinn The Prince

i want to be a billionare
so freakin bad
buy all of the things i never had
